# tatis

This is a project I created to troll my friend Barry. He's a huge [Padres](https://www.mlb.com/padres) fan, and I'm a huge [Dodgers](https://www.mlb.com/dodgers) fan.

The site can be found [here](https://doestatisjrhaveanerrortoday.com)

It answers one simple question:

> Does Fernando Tatis Jr have an error today?

It will return either `Yes` or `No`

And it has a silly image of a throw that Tatis is making. 

If you're a Padre fan you look at it and believe he's making an unbelievable throw to get someone out

If you're not, you know that Tatis is forking up the throw :)
